Decentralized Patient Record Storage
OVERVIEW
Blockchain is a method of recording information that makes it impossible or difficult for the system to be changed, hacked, or manipulated. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in the blockchain.
PROBLEMS
1.	Privacy issues
2.	Owned and controlled by hospitals
3.	Patients does not have access to the data.
4.	Doctor authenticity challenge.
SOLUTION

Blockchain is a technology designed to manage patient data that has the potential to support transparency and accountability. A blockchain is a ledger of transactions where an identical copy is visible to all the members of a computer network. Network members validate the data entered into the ledger, and once entered, the data is immutable.
With the help of Blockchain technology, a solution can be developed to store the EHR of any patient in a distributed and decentralized network. With blockchain solutions, patients can own their data and can approve hospitals, doctors, and research organizations to access their data.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
